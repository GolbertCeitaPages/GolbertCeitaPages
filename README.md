Hi, I’m @GolbertCeitaPages
I'm a Business IT & Management student based in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. 
My majour covers a lot of different aspects of businesses and technology, but what interests me the most is data analytics.
You will mostly find data related projects in my repo's
I also have knowlege of Power BI, Snowlflake and dbt, but prefer to use MySQL and Python for projects on github.
I hope to get better at programming concepts by doing a variety of projects as I am of the opinion that my course thought me a lot about dashboards, but not much of ETL or data manipulation.
